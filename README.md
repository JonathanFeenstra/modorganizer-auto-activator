# Auto-Activator
[Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer) plugin to automatically activate mods on installation.

This is now possible thanks to a [bugfix](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/pull/1837) in version 2.5.0 of Mod Organizer, which has not yet been released at the time of writing. As such, this plugin currently only works with pre-release builds of Mod Organizer v2.5.
